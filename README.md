# Hey there, I'm Jhanvi :wave:
I'm a recent 2025 graduate from the New Jersey Institute of Technology with a degree in Computing and Business and minor in Design of the User Experience. 

I have a passion for problem solving and accessibility in tech. I hope to combine my technical prowess and business acumen in the fields of software engineering, UX design, and technology consulting.
